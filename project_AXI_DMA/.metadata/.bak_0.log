Also, when in Scatter Gather Mode and using the status app length field, this error occurs when the Status AXI4-Stream packet RxLength field does not match the S2MM packet being received by the S_AXIS_S2MM interface. When Scatter Gather is disabled, this error is flagged if any error occurs during Memory write or if the incoming packet is bigger than what is specified in the DMA length register.
This error condition causes the AXI DMA to halt gracefully. The DMACR.RS bit is set to 0, and when the engine has completely shut down, the DMASR.Halted bit is set to 1.      0 - No DMA Internal Errors      1 - DMA Internal Error detected.
